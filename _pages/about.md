I am a final year PhD student in Natural Language Processing at the School of Informatics, University of Edinburgh, supervised by Prof. Jeff Z. Pan and Prof. Mirella Lapata. My research focuses on conversational search, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), large language models (LLMs), and multi-hop question answering.

My work spans several key areas in NLP:
- **Retrieval-Augmented Generation**: Bridging the gap between RAG and LLMs, and exploring the capabilities of LLMs in RAG systems.
- **Large Language Models**: Exploring the capabilities of large language models in conversational search systems and complex question answering / reasoning tasks.
- **Multi-hop Question Answering**: Investigating and improving the capabilities of large language models in complex reasoning tasks. Including long context reasoning and RL-based solutions.

I have published papers in top-tier conferences including IJCNLP, SIGIR, EMNLP, and ACL. My research has received citations from the academic community, contributing to the advancement of conversational AI and knowledge-based systems.

<span style="color: #d6336c; font-weight: bold;">I am currently seeking industry opportunities in NLP, including both internship and full-time positions.</span>
